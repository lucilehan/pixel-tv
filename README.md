# 📺 Pixel TV

> Tune into live YouTube streams inside your IDE — like flipping channels on a retro TV. Sits in your sidebar, remembers your last channel, and shows what's on in the status bar.

## What it does

Pixel TV sits permanently in your sidebar. Pick a **Room**, click a channel, and it keeps playing while you code.

- **First-Run Setup** — handpick your favorite environments on initial install. Only want tech news and lofi? You got it.
- **Rooms** — seven curated environments (The Café, Rainy Library, Mission Control, Vibe Coding, Tech News, Fashion, Sports), each with hand-picked 24/7 live streams.
- **Dynamic Channels** — the channel list is now fetched remotely. No more dead links; if a stream goes offline, it’s fixed universally without an extension update.
- **Channel Memory** — remembers what you were watching. Reopen your IDE and a "Last Watched" banner lets you resume in one click.
- **Status Bar** — shows what's on at all times in the upper-right area. Click it to change room or stop without opening the sidebar.

Think of it less like a video player and more like a TV set that happens to live in your editor — you don't search for content, you just change the channel.

## Usage

Open the Explorer panel and scroll down to **Pixel TV** — or use the keyboard shortcut:

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux |
|--------|-------|-----------------|

Pick a Room, click a channel, and the TV tunes in. The status bar item in the bottom-right shows what's currently on air.

---

## Rooms

Four named environments, each with curated 24/7 live streams:

| Room | Vibe | What's on |
|------|------|-----------|
| ☕ The Café | A corner table by the window. It's raining. | Jazz, bossa nova, coffee shop radio |
| 🌧 Rainy Library | Dark academia. Lamp on. Pages turning. | Lofi Girl, Chillhop |
| 🚀 Mission Control | Synthwave and neon. Somewhere in the future. | Synthwave Plaza, retrowave |
| 🧑‍💻 Vibe Coding | Others are coding too. You're not alone. | Brain Food, study-with-me |
| 📰 Tech News | Live tech updates and stock coverage. | Bloomberg News, Reuters, Tech Live |
| 👗 Fashion | Runway shows and lo-fi fashion streams. | FashionTV, Vogue Runway |
| 🏅 Sports | Live scores, highlights, and sports radio. | Sky Sports, TalkSport |

## Live Stream Search (optional)

If you want to search beyond the built-in channels, add a free YouTube Data API v3 key in Settings — the search bar will then pull live streams directly from YouTube.

**To set up:**
1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a free API key with YouTube Data API v3 enabled
2. Open your IDE settings and search `pixelTv`
3. Paste your key into **Pixel TV: Youtube Api Key**

Your key is stored locally in your IDE's settings and never committed to any repository.

Without a key, the search bar filters the built-in channel list only.
